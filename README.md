# react-state-eval

Evaluate some React State libraries.

A markdown presentation is stored in the `presentation` sub-folder.

The test code is in the form of simple
React projects with some simple code to exercise the state store. There is
a sub-folder for each evaualted package.

Each of the solutions is built using `parcel`, so the process to run them is similar.

Build output will be stored in a dist sub-folder.

```bash
cd zustand
npm install
npm run serve
